# UPL: The Dark Age

> We stand in the ruins of a long lost lab. Technological
> marvels whirl and buzz, beyond our limited understanding.
> This is an age of dusk and darkness. The sun has set, and all the wizards gone.
>
> We seek to restore honor to this sacred shrine! To cast out ignorance from
> these hallowed lands Bart bestowed upon us.
> We will fight to the dying daybreak for the glory of a new age!

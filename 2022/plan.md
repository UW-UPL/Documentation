## UPL Infrastructure Plan/ Goals
1. Catalogue of what equipment we have, what's working
2. Determine what we can tear down and experiment with
3. Documentation - what do we need to keep the UPL running? (Or make it run - it's not exactly running right now)
    * Kerberos - how does kerberos to CSL work? Do we want to do it differently? upl-admin and add-user and add-coord scripts not all working, maybe a better way to do it
    * Network - switch configuration, how do we get our ips?
    * DHCP, bind - how are the configured and used
4. Get the essentials working on a rebuilt server

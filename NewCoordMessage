"Hey bud! So, you were the selected coord for the UPL for this coming Spring and on. Do you still want to do it / can you commit to 2 office hours per week of keeping the lab open plus doing one event per academic year? If so let me know ASAP and I will be in touch with the first meeting you should come to towards the end of the semester in about a month."

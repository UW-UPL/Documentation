## General Conduct
Inspired by [The Hack Code of Conduct](http://hackcodeofconduct.org/)

By participating in UPL activities, all participants implicitly agree to this Code of Conduct, enforced by UPL Coordinators. Cooperation is expected to ensure a safe environment.

### The Quick Version
The UPL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or computing experience. Harassment in any form is not tolerated. Sexual language and imagery are inappropriate. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the coordinators and administrators.

### The Long Version
Harassment includes:
- Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion.
- Sexual images in public spaces.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following.
- Photography or recording without consent.
- Sustained disturbance.
- Inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior must comply immediately.

If you are being harassed or notice someone else being harassed, contact a [Coordinator](https://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/coords/) immediately.

Coordinators and administrators may take any action deemed appropriate, including warnings or expulsion.

These rules apply at UPL-related events and in the online forum.

## Account / Member Policies
The UPL was established for students to learn about computers. While exploration is supported, consider other users and the UPL's security needs. Violations may lead to account locking or deletion.

1. Do not break into other accounts or computers, crack passwords, or subvert security systems. Do not steal passwords, files, or information.
2. Do not delete others' files, disrupt accessibility, usability, or performance. Do not harass or threaten other users.
3. Do not disrupt the accessibility, usability, or performance of UPL resources. Distasteful or offensive displays, printouts, or files will be removed.
4. Pirating copyrighted material is prohibited. Contact a coordinator to arrange appropriate use of UPL resources if needed.
5. Members may only be in the lab when a Coordinator is present. If the last Coordinator leaves, the room must be closed and vacated.

## Other Prohibited Activities
- Cryptocurrency mining
- Rainbow table construction
- Unauthorized distributed computing programs
- Sleeping in the Lab

## Additional Guidelines
- Do not leave your belongings in the lab. We are not responsible for them.

## Accountability Process
When a violation is reported:

- The on-site Coordinator addresses concerns with the member and records the response.
- If unresolved, the issue is reviewed by a panel of 3+ Coordinators and the UPL Faculty Advisor. The member is notified in writing of the action taken. Possible responses include:
  - Restitution
  - Limiting access to specific times
  - Removal of access for a specified period
  - Expulsion
- Members can appeal within 7 days of the decision. Appeals are based on the record and heard by the UPL Advisor.

## Liability Disclaimer
UPL is not liable for any actions, behavior, or incidents on its premises, during events, or in the online forum. By participating, members agree to hold UPL, its staff, and its affiliates harmless from any claims or damages. UPL reserves the right to amend the Code of Conduct and policies at any time. Members must stay informed of changes.

## Intellectual Property Liability Release
UPL is not responsible for the theft or misuse of intellectual property. Members should protect their intellectual property. By participating, members release UPL, its staff, and its affiliates from any claims or damages related to intellectual property theft or misuse.

## Acknowledgment of Codes of Conduct
By participating in UPL activities, members acknowledge that they are familiar with and agree to adhere to the [UW Madison Student Code of Conduct](https://conduct.students.wisc.edu/) and the [Wisconsin Administrative Code UWS](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/uws).

## Relationship to University Policies

This Code of Conduct is intended to supplement—not replace or override—the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s official policies, including but not limited to its Non-Discrimination and Harassment policies. In cases of conflict or overlap, University policy always takes precedence. All participants remain subject to university-wide expectations and procedures for reporting and resolving discrimination, harassment, or misconduct.

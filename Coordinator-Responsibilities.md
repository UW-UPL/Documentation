# UPL Coordinator Responsibilities

Each coordinator will agree to:

0. Be a UW-Madison registered student. Graduate or Undergraduate, full or part time. If you stop being a registered student suddenly, you MUST relinquish your coordinator status, as per Bart Miller. 
1. Have WisCard door access (a CURRENT coord must ask Bart for this. It requires the number on the back of the WisCard). Without access, one is not a coordinator.
2. Be responsible for the lab when they're in it.
3. Attend every coordinator meeting possible.
4. Try their best to enforce the code of conduct.
5. Hold a minimum of 2 office hours a week during the semester.
  * Each office hour will be posted publicly on the upl website.
6. Work on something UPL related once a week.
  * Note: One of your office hours is a perfect time for this!
7. Make a good effort on learning the UPL internal system administration.
  * Check the documentation we have. Ask for help. No excuses.
8. Majorly contribute to at least one UPL related event per year.
  * Examples: Tech Talk, Interview Night, UPL Games, GameHax, etc.
